## JokeDapp: A Decentralized Joke Contest Dapp

### Introduction

JokeDapp is a decentralized application where users can participate in joke contests by answering multiple-choice questions. To participate, users pay a fee in Ether, and if they answer correctly, they win rewards that can be claimed directly within the app. The platform allows for a fun, interactive experience, leveraging smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This project showcases my skills in full-stack blockchain development, including smart contract design, frontend integration, and the use of Next.js with Web3 tools like wagmi, viem, and React Query.

### üöÄ Features

- Decentralized Joke Contests: Users answer joke questions and win rewards.
- Wallet Integration: Seamlessly connect your Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.
- Reward Claiming: Users can claim their rewards directly on the platform.
- Admin Controls: The owner can withdraw collected fees.
- Smart Contracts: Deployed on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet, ensuring trust and security.
- Real-time Updates: Dynamic updates on the number of participants, contest results, and more.

### üíª Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- wagmi & viem for Web3 integration
- Tanstack React Query for data fetching and caching
- Solidity for writing smart contracts
- Foundry for testing and deployment
- Makefile and .env for streamlined environment management and build processes

### üì¶ Installation & Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kilamaelie/jokes-dapp.git
cd jokes-dapp
```

2. Install dependencies:xw

```bash
cd client
yarn dev
```

3. Set up the environment:

- Create a .env.local file in the root directory and populate it with the following variables for client :

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 # for example
```

- Create a .env file in the root directory and populate it with the following variables for contract:

```bash
RPC_URL_LOCAL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https//_____  # add yours
SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=
LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY==
```

4. Makefile for Build Automation:

- This project uses a Makefile to simplify various development tasks like compiling smart contracts, running tests, and more. You can use commands like:

```bash

make compile  # Compile the smart contracts
make test     # Run smart contract tests
make deploy-test # Deploy the contracts to the blockchain locally
make deploy-t # Deploy the contracts to the blockchain locally
make deploy-sepolia # Deploy the contracts to the blockchain remotely

```

5. Run the app:

```bash
yarn dev

```

6. Compile and deploy the contracts (if needed):

```bash
forge build
make deploy-sepolia
```

### üõ† Architecture

Frontend: Built with Next.js, wagmi, and viem to provide a smooth Web3 experience.
Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
Data Fetching: React Query is used to efficiently fetch and cache contract data.
Environment Variables: Managed through a .env file for secure configuration.

### üîß Makefile Commands

A Makefile has been provided to streamline common operations. Here are the available commands:

- make compile: Compiles the Solidity contracts using Foundry.
- make test: Runs the smart contract tests.
- make deploy-test: Deploys the smart contracts to the Sepolia testnet.
- make clean: Cleans the build artifacts.
